[Kuzu](https://kuzudb.com/) is an embedded graph database with native vector capabilities, providing a lightweight and high-performance solution for both vector storage and graph operations in a single database.

### Usage

```python
import os
from mem0 import Memory

os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "sk-xx"

config = {
    "vector_store": {
        "provider": "kuzu",
        "config": {
            "collection_name": "memories",
            "db_path": "./kuzu_db",
            "vector_dimension": 1536,
            "distance_metric": "cosine"
        }
    }
}

m = Memory.from_config(config)
messages = [
    {"role": "user", "content": "I'm planning to watch a movie tonight. Any recommendations?"},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "How about a thriller movies? They can be quite engaging."},
    {"role": "user", "content": "I'm not a big fan of thriller movies but I love sci-fi movies."},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Got it! I'll avoid thriller recommendations and suggest sci-fi movies in the future."}
]
m.add(messages, user_id="alice", metadata={"category": "movies"})
```

### Config

Here are the parameters available for configuring Kuzu:

| Parameter | Description | Default Value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `collection_name` | Name for the Kuzu node table used as collection | `memories` |
| `db_path` | Path to the Kuzu database directory | `./kuzu_db` |
| `vector_dimension` | Dimension of vectors to store | `1536` |
| `distance_metric` | Distance metric to use for similarity search (cosine, euclidean, dot) | `cosine` |

### Benefits

- **Simplified Deployment**: As an embedded database, Kuzu runs within your application process with no external dependencies
- **Combined Vector and Graph Capabilities**: Store both vector embeddings and graph relationships in the same database
- **Efficient Vector Search**: Utilizes optimized vector indexes for fast similarity search
- **Transaction Support**: Provides ACID-compliant transactions for data consistency
- **Performance**: Lightweight and optimized for speed and memory efficiency

### Implementation Details

Kuzu vector store implementation uses a node table with three fields:
- `id`: STRING PRIMARY KEY - unique identifier for each vector
- `vector`: FLOAT[] - the actual vector data
- `payload`: STRING - JSON serialized metadata

All vector operations (insert, search, delete, update) utilize Kuzu's Cypher query capabilities, with optimized vector similarity search using the configured distance metric.
