# Kuzu Integration Active Context

## Current Implementation Focus

The focus has been on implementing and testing the Kuzu integration for both vector store and graph memory functionalities, ensuring compatibility with Kuzu v0.8.2 API, which introduced significant changes to connection handling.

### Recent Changes and Decisions

1. **Test Structure Reorganization**
   - Removed redundant integration test directories that didn't follow the project's established patterns
   - Added graph memory tests to a new `tests/graphs` directory following project conventions
   - Fixed mocking patterns to properly handle singleton classes and inheritance

2. **API Compatibility**
   - Updated KuzuConnectionManager to use the new Kuzu v0.8.2 API with `db.create_connection()` method
   - Added explicit tests for API compatibility to ensure forward compatibility
   - Documented API changes in api_updates.md

3. **Documentation Updates**
   - Updated progress.md with current implementation status
   - Created comprehensive documentation for migration from Neo4j
   - Added examples for both vector store and graph memory use cases

## Cross-Component Dependencies

1. **KuzuConnectionManager**
   - Central component that both KuzuVectorStore and KuzuMemoryGraph depend on
   - Implemented as a singleton to ensure shared connections
   - Handles transaction management for both components

2. **Factory Integration**
   - Integrated with VectorStoreFactory and GraphMemoryFactory
   - Ensured proper registration of Kuzu providers in factory patterns

3. **Configuration Dependencies**
   - Added configuration schemas in vector_stores/configs.py
   - Ensured backward compatibility with existing configuration patterns

## Next Steps

1. **Testing Completion**
   - Ensure comprehensive test coverage for both vector store and graph memory implementations
   - Verify proper error handling and edge cases

2. **Performance Benchmarks**
   - Complete the benchmarks/kuzu_benchmarks.py implementation
   - Compare performance against other vector stores and graph stores

3. **Documentation Finalization**
   - Finalize user-facing documentation
   - Ensure all examples are complete and functional

4. **Dependency Management**
   - Finalize optional dependency handling in pyproject.toml
   - Document installation requirements for users

## Implementation Challenges

1. **Mocking Singleton Classes**
   - Addressed challenge with proper patching of `__new__` to avoid inheritance issues
   - Ensured tests don't interfere with each other when using singleton classes

2. **API Compatibility**
   - Ensured compatibility with Kuzu v0.8.2 while maintaining clear requirements
   - Added proper error messages for users with older versions

3. **Transaction Management**
   - Implemented proper transaction handling for atomic operations
   - Ensured rollback on errors to maintain database integrity
