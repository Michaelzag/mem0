# Kuzu Integration Dependency Updates

## Integration Approach

Following the project's CONTRIBUTING.md guidelines, we've implemented the Kuzu integration using these steps:

1. Fork and clone the repository
2. Create a feature branch `feature/kuzu-integration` 
3. Update the code for Kuzu v0.8.2 compatibility
4. Add tests for the new functionality
5. Add documentation for the integration
6. Ensure all tests pass

## API Compatibility Updates

1. Updated `KuzuConnectionManager` to use v0.8.2 API:
   - Changed `kuzu.Connection(self.db)` to `self.db.create_connection()`
   - All internal methods remain the same, providing backward compatibility

2. Test Updates:
   - Added conditional imports in test files to handle Kuzu availability
   - Updated `Config` class import reference in compatibility tests
   - Added skip markers to tests that require Kuzu

## Installation and Testing (Following CONTRIBUTING.md)

For implementing and testing the Kuzu integration:

```bash
# 1. Install all dependencies as specified in CONTRIBUTING.md
make install_all

# 2. Activate the poetry environment
poetry shell

# 3. Install pre-commit hooks
pre-commit install

# 4. Run all tests to ensure everything works
make test
```

This follows the project's established conventions as outlined in CONTRIBUTING.md.

## Dependency Management

The integration adds Kuzu v0.8.2 as a dependency. As stated in CONTRIBUTING.md, "Several packages have been removed from Poetry to make the package lighter", so we've included Kuzu in the appropriate area to maintain compatibility while adhering to the project's package management approach.

## Pull Request Process

After implementing and testing, we'll:
1. Push changes to our fork's feature branch
2. Create a pull request with details about the Kuzu integration
3. Address any feedback during the PR review

This ensures we follow the contribution guidelines fully while integrating Kuzu with mem0.
