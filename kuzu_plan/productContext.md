# Product Context: Kuzu Integration

---

## Project Purpose

The Kuzu integration aims to provide mem0 with an embedded graph database solution that combines vector search capabilities, simplifying deployment and improving performance. This integration will offer users a lightweight alternative to the current Neo4j-based implementation.

## Detailed Requirements

1. **Vector Store Implementation**
   - Create a Kuzu-based vector store implementation that conforms to mem0's VectorStoreBase interface
   - Support all vector operations: insert, search, delete, update, get
   - Implement proper error handling and logging
   - Ensure compatibility with existing vector store workflows

2. **Graph Memory Implementation**
   - Create a Kuzu-based graph memory implementation as an alternative to Neo4j
   - Implement all methods currently in MemoryGraph using Kuzu's Cypher capabilities
   - Support complex graph queries and traversals
   - Maintain compatibility with existing graph memory workflows

3. **Integration Requirements**
   - Update factory classes to include Kuzu implementations
   - Provide configuration options for Kuzu vector store and graph memory
   - Enable shared database usage for both vector and graph operations
   - Document migration paths from existing implementations

4. **User Experience Goals**
   - Simplified deployment with no external database dependencies
   - Consistent API experience with current mem0 implementations
   - Performance comparable to or better than existing solutions
   - Clear documentation and examples for adoption

## Success Criteria

1. All Kuzu implementations pass the existing test suite for compatibility
2. Deployment complexity is reduced compared to Neo4j approach
3. Documentation provides clear migration path and usage examples
4. Performance benchmarks show comparable or improved performance
5. No regression in existing functionality when using Kuzu implementations
