## Component Relationships

- **KuzuConnectionManager** (mem0/utils/kuzu_connection.py)
  - Core singleton manager for database connections
  - Used by both KuzuVectorStore and KuzuMemoryGraph
  - Updated to use Kuzu v0.8.2 API

- **KuzuVectorStore** (mem0/vector_stores/kuzu.py)
  - Implements VectorStoreBase for Kuzu
  - Uses KuzuConnectionManager for database access
  - Provides vector storage and similarity search capabilities

- **KuzuMemoryGraph** (mem0/memory/graph_memory_kuzu.py)
  - Implements graph-based memory storage
  - Uses KuzuConnectionManager for database access
  - Provides entity and relationship storage and retrieval

## Testing Coverage

- **Vector Store Tests** (tests/vector_stores/test_kuzu.py)
  - Tests initialization, collection creation, CRUD operations
  - Tests connection management and vector similarity search

- **Graph Memory Tests** (tests/graphs/test_kuzu.py)
  - Tests graph memory operations: add, search, delete
  - Tests entity extraction and relationship management
  - Tests connection management and singleton pattern
  - Tests API compatibility with Kuzu v0.8.2

## Documentation Status

- Added components documentation
- Added migration guide from Neo4j
- Added usage examples for both vector store and graph memory functionalities
- Added API compatibility documentation

## Dependency Management

- Added Kuzu as an optional dependency
- Ensured compatibility with Kuzu v0.8.2 or later
- Added version compatibility checks
