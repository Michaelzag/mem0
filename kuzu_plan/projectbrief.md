# Kuzu Integration Project Brief

---

## Core Purpose

This project aims to integrate Kuzu, an embedded graph database with vector search capabilities, into the mem0 memory layer. The integration will leverage Kuzu's combined graph and vector capabilities to provide an alternative to the current Neo4j-based graph memory implementation, while also offering a new vector store option.

## Project Boundaries

- Focus on creating both vector store and graph memory implementations using Kuzu
- Maintain compatibility with existing mem0 interfaces and functionality
- Provide configuration options for seamless adoption by users
- Document usage patterns and benefits

## Fundamental Constraints

- Must implement all required interfaces and methods of mem0's abstraction layers
- Must maintain compatibility with existing mem0 functionality
- Implementation should leverage Kuzu's optimized query processing capabilities
- Must support both vector operations and graph operations
