# System Patterns: Kuzu Integration

---

## Architecture Patterns

1. **Interface Conformance**
   - All Kuzu implementations must strictly adhere to existing mem0 interfaces
   - KuzuVectorStore must implement VectorStoreBase
   - KuzuMemoryGraph must implement the same interface as current MemoryGraph

2. **Factory Pattern Usage**
   - Use existing factory patterns for component instantiation
   - Extend VectorStoreFactory to include Kuzu implementation
   - Update factory initialization logic for graph memory

3. **Configuration Consistency**
   - Follow existing configuration structure and naming conventions
   - Ensure backward compatibility with existing configuration options
   - Provide sensible defaults for new configuration parameters

4. **Unified Database Access**
   - Implement design pattern to share a single Kuzu database instance
   - Enable coordinated transaction management
   - Ensure proper connection lifecycle management

## Coding Standards

1. **Implementation Style**
   - Follow existing mem0 coding style and conventions
   - Use type hints consistently
   - Implement proper error handling and logging
   - Include comprehensive docstrings for all classes and methods

2. **Testing Requirements**
   - Create unit tests for all public methods
   - Include integration tests for component interactions
   - Provide performance benchmark tests
   - Test compatibility with existing mem0 functionality

3. **Error Handling**
   - Implement graceful error handling for database operations
   - Convert Kuzu-specific errors to mem0 standard exceptions
   - Include detailed error messages for troubleshooting
   - Log appropriate information for debugging

## Implementation Guidelines

1. **Database Connection Management**
   - Initialize database connection only when needed
   - Implement proper connection pooling if necessary
   - Ensure connections are properly closed to prevent resource leaks

2. **Vector Operations**
   - Use Kuzu's vector indexing capabilities for similarity search
   - Optimize batch operations for vector inserts and updates
   - Implement proper serialization/deserialization of vector data

3. **Graph Operations**
   - Translate mem0 graph operations to Kuzu's Cypher dialect
   - Optimize graph traversal patterns for Kuzu
   - Ensure proper handling of node and relationship properties

4. **Performance Considerations**
   - Minimize database round-trips for common operations
   - Use batch processing where applicable
   - Optimize query patterns for Kuzu's execution engine
   - Consider memory usage patterns for embedded database
