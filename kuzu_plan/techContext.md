# Technology Context: Kuzu Integration

---

## Technology Stack

1. **Kuzu**
   - Version: Latest stable release
   - Purpose: Embedded graph database with vector search capabilities
   - Role: Primary database for both vector and graph storage
   - Repository: https://github.com/kuzudb/kuzu

2. **mem0**
   - Current codebase
   - Role: Memory framework being extended
   - Components used:
     - VectorStoreBase interface
     - MemoryGraph class/interface
     - Factory patterns for component instantiation

3. **Python**
   - Version: 3.8+ (compatible with mem0 requirements)
   - Primary implementation language

4. **Neo4j**
   - Current graph database implementation
   - Used as reference for graph operations and Cypher compatibility

## Technical Constraints

1. **Interface Compatibility**
   - Must implement all methods required by mem0 interfaces
   - Must maintain backward compatibility with existing code

2. **Performance Requirements**
   - Vector operations should be comparable or better than current implementations
   - Graph operations should be efficient for common query patterns

3. **Deployment Constraints**
   - Should work as an embedded database without external dependencies
   - Must support all operating systems supported by mem0

4. **Serialization Format**
   - Vector data must be properly serialized/deserialized
   - Payload data needs JSON compatibility

## Dependencies

1. **Core Dependencies**
   - Kuzu Python package and its requirements
   - All existing mem0 dependencies

2. **Optional Dependencies**
   - Performance monitoring tools
   - Benchmarking utilities

3. **Development Dependencies**
   - Testing frameworks
   - Code linting and formatting tools

## Development Environment

1. **Required Tools**
   - Python development environment
   - mem0 development setup
   - Kuzu installation and dependencies

2. **Testing Environment**
   - Unit test framework
   - Integration test environment
   - Performance benchmarking tools

3. **Documentation Tools**
   - Markdown for documentation
   - Code documentation generators

## Migration Considerations

1. **Compatibility Layers**
   - May need temporary compatibility between Neo4j and Kuzu
   - Need migration tooling for existing data

2. **Version Support**
   - Support Kuzu version evolution
   - Handle potential API changes
